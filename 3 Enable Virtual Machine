Enable Virtual Machine Feature
Enable the Virtual Machine Platform feature. Your system will require BIOS-level hardware virtualization support which must be enabled in the BIOS settings.

You can check whether virtualization support is enabled by checking your Task Manager.
  


Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

Powershell

dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
Restart your PC.
